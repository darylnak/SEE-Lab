    "The purpose of this task is to give you a chance to get familiar with some techniques for analyzing EEG signals using Python. Our goal will be to predict whether or not a segment of data from an EEG corresponds to a seizure or not. Our analysis will consist of three main steps which are described in detail below."

    "## Step 1: Reading the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this project comes from the \"Physionet\" database collected by the Children's Hospital of Boston. The data consits of EEG recordings gathered from 10 children and young adults with medically resistant epilepsy. Each test subject has around 50 hours of recordings so there's a lot of data! A neurologist then went through all the data by hand and identified all the seizures. So each sample gets a value of `1` if it corresponds to a seizure and a `0` if not. The data was collected in a hospital setting and more subjects have data from at least 20 different electrodes. However, to be closer to the environment faced by developers of embedded systems we'll only look at two channels that are located near the temples. You can see some more detailed information about the data [here](https://physionet.org/content/chbmit/1.0.0/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `../input/` folder you'll find a file `eeg_data_temples2.h5` which contains all the EEG recordings for the two channels we're interested in. Our first step will be to read this data into Python and convert it into a format our algorithm can work with. To do so, we'll use the `tables` library for Python which can read the `HDF5` file format which is used to store the EEG data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Side Note: Model Estimation and Feature Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task we want to classify a short segment (commonly called a \"window\") of an EEG recording (4 seconds to be exact) as either being a during a seizure or not. To do so, we will use a logistic regression model. Very succinctly, a lostic regression is a statistical model which can be used predicts the value of a binary random variable (i.e. a random variable which takes on exactly two discrete values) known as the \"outcome\" or \"dependent variable,\" given a set of observations of one or more \"input\" or \"independent\" variables. Very succinctly, suppose we have two input variables $x_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ (where $\\mathbb{R}$ denotes the real numbers) and a discrete outcome $y \\in \\{0,1\\}$. Then logistic regression first computes a linear function of those variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and then \"squashes\" $z$ through a function (called the logistic-sigmoid) which converts $z$ into a probability. Putting both steps together we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Pr(y = 1 | x_1, x_2) = \\sigma(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$ is the logistic sigmoid. In general, we don't know $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2$ and need to *estimate* them from some data. The $\\beta$ are known as the model \"parameters\" and the process of estimating them is called \"parameter estimation\" (there's an entire ECE course that is just about parameter estimation). The algorithm to do this is somewhat complicated, but fortunately some other people have already implemented it for us. We just need to give their implementation a bunch of data corresponding to several observed values of $x_1$ and $x_2$ along with the correct value of $y$ for those data points. Their algorithm will give us back the \"best\" values of $\\beta$. Then, if we observe values for $x_1$ and $x_2$ for which we *do not* know the correct value of $y$, we can plug those into the equation above along with the estimated values for the $\\beta$ and compute the probabilty that these $x$ correspond to $y=1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very over-simplified description of logistic regression which has a number of interesting interpretations both statistically and geometrically which you're encouraged to read more about [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression). In particular, I recommend reading the first two \"examples\" to get a bit more technical understanding of how the model works and how we define the \"best\" value of the $\\beta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case the outcome variable will be \"given the last four seconds of EEG data, is the person having a seizure?\" So in this case our $x$ variables will be some variables which summarize the last four seconds of observed EEG data and our $y$ variable will be a $1$ if the person was having a seizure at any point in the last four seconds. The question of how to best summarize the signal so that a logistic regression gives good results has been the subject of considerable research and people have proposed a bunch of different values to extract from the seizure which may be useful. In this case we'll use a very simple model that uses the mean and variance of the signal in each window along with some features of the \"frequency domain\" which are well known to be useful by medical researchers. The term \"frequency domain\" refers to the representation of the signal obtained by computing its Fourier Transform. Recall that the [Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) takes a signal which is measured as a function of time and decomposes it into a superposition of primitive waves oscilating at different frequencies. In many cases (including this one), the relative importance of these waves tells us useful things about the signal so it's very common to analyze signals in the frequency domain. If you don't know about Fourier Transforms, that's fine, but I recommend reading about them (or look up the 3Blue1Brown video about them) because they are very interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "So our first task will be to read the raw data collected on EEG and extract the various \"features\" from the raw signal."
